## What is Bitir?
Bitir is a web/mobile app which allows users to reach excess food sold at a discounted price selected by the company selling the food. An example can be, Liva wanting to sell the excess cakes it has at the end of the day instead of throwing them out and thus creating an announcement on Bitir for the users and organizations to get cakes for cheap. We aim to have an affect on optimizing the food distiribution efficiency and limit the food waste.
